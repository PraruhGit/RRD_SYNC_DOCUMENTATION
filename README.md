# RRD_SYNC_DOCUMENTATION
This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for setting up and managing a bidirectional file synchronization system using Rsync between two servers:

Server Primary: Initially designated as the Primary Source.
Server Secondary: Initially designated as the Secondary Destination.

The synchronization ensures that files are consistently mirrored between the two servers, with an automated failover mechanism that promotes the secondary server to primary in case of failure, maintaining data integrity and availability.
